-	APX has so far invested in over 120 startups and will invest in over 200 by the end of 2022
-	Our goal as an early stage VC is to provide startups with added value beyond the funding (e.g.: introductions to potential clients, feedback calls with experts, etc) to help them achieve product-market fit.
-	In order to support startups in reaching PMF, we want to create scalable processes that preserve personal connections and the human factor.
-	There are some processes that are time-consuming, very manual, and create bottlenecks due to the growing number of startups (2 weeks to 2 months).
-	It’s becoming more difficult to keep track of everything and provide the right support at the right moment
