0,Deepgears,www.deepgears.com,"Incorrect sizes and unmet expectations on how garments fit represent not only the main drivers of returns, but also a significant inconvenience for customers who often resort to ordering multiple sizes to then send the unwanted items back. This process is cumbersome for customers, detrimental for both retailers' profitability and the environment, and urgent to solve (Rebound Returns data shows that apparel returns have skyrocketed by 63% during the pandemic). We, at DeepGears, are developing a software aiming at solving this problem.

With DeepGears, online shoppers can:

● Visualize how garments truly fit on their virtual character, featuring their very same body measurements
● Find out their perfect size
● Discover DeepGears’ recommended products, empowered by advanced analytics on users’ physical trait data

As a result, online consumers will shop online more easily, enjoying an experience closer to reality and ultimately return fewer unwanted items. Drawing from a successful Shopify’s case study on accessories, we have estimated that products equipped with DeepGears' software will experience a 20+% sales increase and 30+% reduction in returns.

0,Shapematchr,https://shapematchr.com ,"OUR SOLUTION: 

We have developed an app that allows users to create, manage and share their personal shopping profile based on their individual body measurements and shopping preferences. 

Users can share their profiles with friends and family - but also with fashion brands and later other body shape related product offers and services. 

The data belong to the user. 

Directly within the app, users have access to online brand stores - in which we currently show them via a slide over which size fits them in which way at the respective brand. 

That can be very different. For me - Stefanie - Co-Founder & CEO of Shapmeatchr - it varies from brand to brand between M and XXL. 

Users can also connect directly to brand stores with their app and their profile. By matching product data, body data, and preferences, the brands can make recommendations that fit exactly. 

This leads to fewer returns, more trust in online shopping and higher conversion rates. 

OUR VISION: 

Shapematchr - as a profile for life - that connects you to perfect fitting body measure related products and services worldwide. 

The Shapematchr profile could be used for 

perfect fit mobility sharing 

real life avatars in the Metaverse or Microsoft Teams, 

ergonomic furniture & gym equipment

There are only so many google tabs one can keep track of before you give up and decide to just go to the restaurant down the street again. Google Maps, Tripadvisor, Yelp, Timeout and others don’t solve this problem. They do little to gather the right experiences, and generally offer nothing for personalization.  About us:

• We've assembled a world class team that is experienced, humble, and a blast to work with. Culture is extremely important to us and we’ve heard from our team that this is the most important work of their career and the most fun they’ve had.

• Our team collectively has decades of extensive, relevant experience in similar companies. We led and built teams, exited or IPO'd with some of the fastest growing tech companies, and have already built similar products at world class companies. We are fortunate to have this level of talent so early in our journey with Bigfoot.

•  In early 2022 we raised an oversubscribed $1.5M pre-seed round from a tremendous list of experienced, strategic angel investors, funds, and late stage VCs making personal investments. This included from APX as our lead investor, Accel's scout program, and iGlobe Partners out of Singapore.

• Completely redesigned and launched Bigfoot for scalability with a laser focus on becoming THE solution for local experience discovery. We are now live on all surfaces (iOS, desktop, and mobile web) in 160 cities around the world with 60,000 experiences for our users to discover and enjoy.

• We've integrated a range of next-gen technologies into Bigfoot, including ML / AI into a range of areas of our business, incl a direct API connection with GPT. This supercharges our ability to serve compelling, personalized experiences for our users.

0,GreenBytes,,"One third of all food produced globally ends up in the garbage. This enormous amount of waste is one of the world’s largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, not to mention an enormous waste of money. 
Food waste in retailers comes from overordering food. 

Which is where GreenBytes comes in. GreenBytes is a cloud-based solution for food retailers to save money and reduce waste. 
We tell retailers how much food they should be ordering. To do this we developed a progressive web application that breaks down menus, tracks inventory, and predicts future food consumption using machine learning algorithms. We use artificial intelligence that inputs past sales, weather data, and holidays to predict future sales.
Once we predict future sales, we suggest how much of each raw ingredient the restaurant should order in the upcoming days. If the restaurant agrees with our suggestion, they can approve the order and the GreenBytes app will automatically send out the order to all their distributors at one time.",b2b,seed,Reykjavik,greenbytes@greenbytes.is,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rvk-greenbytes

0,Pickler,,"Pickler was founded in 2021. We (Koen de Beer and Daan van Hal) were looking into taking over a supplier of self proclaimed biodegradable bags. However, there was no evidence for these claims. 

Instead of buying this company, we decided to dive into this problem of proving sustainability. We conducted around 30 interviews with packaging suppliers and buyers and learned that proving sustainability is difficult and leads to guesswork and false claims.

To impact the switch to sustainable packaging, we needed to provide evidence based insights at scale for buyers and suppliers. With evidence, both sides would have a story about sustainability that is based on proof, instead of gut feeling. 

We teamed up with Sustainability Impact Metrics (a spin-off of the Technical University Delft). Together, we developed an instant, scalable and transparent life cycle assessment for packaging. With standardized emissions data, we could now run calculations about packaging footprint at scale.

When testing prototypes of our model with buyers and suppliers, we already impacted decisions in favor of sustainability. With providing evidence based sustainability insights for buyers and sellers we want to contribute to a more sustainable world and reach a saving of 100 million kg CO2 by 2025.
